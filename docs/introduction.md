# Enterprise Application Integration

If you have disparate technologies like Java, DB, SAP etc in order to
integrate in a single secure manner you need EAI

ESB is how to implement the concept of EAI.
Advantages are message transformation, message routing, message
enrichment, protocol conversion.

> **Note**
>CastIron (Cloud ESB) + IIB = ACE/ACP (ACP is on the Cloud). 

Upto V9 WMB
you could run older versions of WMB code and WESB. IBM Integration Bus
represents the IBM strategic Enterprise Service Bus offering and is the
successor product for existing clients of both IBM WebSphere Message
Broker and IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus. From V10 IIB does not
need MQ but now can install MQ on a separate server and connect
remotely. IIB (V10) has Salesforce and NoSQL database
connectivity.

# Design, requirements gathering

What questions will you ask? How will you implement these? For example,
if you want to expose a web service what kind of notes will you
take?
